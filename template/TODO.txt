1- fix the aesthetic design part
2- search system that works from the homepage
3- realistic match system --> it is currently printed on screen 100% for everyone
4- profile: switch state button that changes the status from "looking" to "found" and vice versa.

missing but unimportant parts:
- registration of a new profile
- editing a profile
- beautify "homepage_not_logged.php", or the home page, when the user is not logged in
